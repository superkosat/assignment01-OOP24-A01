6. Wait on the next screen and refresh after 2-3 seconds.

7. After the refresh, you should get your submission repo link and a button to redirect to VS Code to start working.

8. Click on the VS Code button; it will open VS Code on your computer. Follow the instructions on the screen.

   - Login to your GitHub account, allowing VS Code access to your repo.

   - If VS Code gives a warning prompt, click on "I trust this author."

9. After logging in and following on screen instruction, you will get your project repo on your VSCode.

10. After making any changes to the code i.e completing assignment task, you can commit changes to GitHub easily through the source control extension in VS Code.

   - Dont Forget to add a commit message,
   - You can either do commit and push later or commit and push at same time.
   - after each commit wait 1 min for autograder to do its commit, or else later it will cause a merger issue, difficult but can be resolved.
   - before you make new commit first pull the update repo.

11. **Happy Coding!!!**

## NOTE:

- Final commit before due date will be considered for grading.
- After every push, and before you make a new commit, do a pull on your repo. This is because whenever you do a push, the autograder runs and pushes some new commits to your repo.
- If certain instructions are not clear, you can attend the Office Hour of the course tutor – Affan Khamse (ak10529@nyu.edu) for further clarity.

## Before You Start:
- In "main.cpp," you have given different test cases that can help you test your code. Make sure that all of them run successfully when you run your code.
- It is crucial to submit a working program (Non-working applications will not be considered).
- For all three task ,your requried to work(make changes) ONLY one file per task:
      - `list_todo.h`
      - `stack_todo.h`
      - `generic_list_todo.h`

         
 
## Task 1 - Linked List

For this task, you have been given following files:

- **list_tests.h**: Contains some required code (you should NOT modify this file)
- **list_todo.h**: Will contain the code that you must fill.

The aim of the code is to implement a dynamic linked list of int values. The struct of each node and the list is provided in the file `list_todo.h` as follows:

```
class Node {
public:
    int value;
    Node* next;
};

class List {
public:
    Node* head;
    int size;
}; 
```
You need to implement the code for the following methods in the file "todo.h":

- `List()`
  - Non-parameters constructor.

- `List(int v)`
  - With-parameters constructor.

- `List(List& l)`
  - A copy constructor.

- `~List()`
  - A destructor.

- `void add(int v)`
  - A method to add a new value to the end of the list.

- `int pop()`
  - A method that returns the value that exists in the last node of the list and removes this node.

- `bool operator==(const List& rhs)`
  - A method to compare between two lists using the == operator.

- `bool operator!=(const List& rhs)`
  - A method to compare between two lists using the != operator.

- `friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, List& l)`
  - A function to create an output stream from a list using the `operator <<` (this is mainly used to print the list using `cout <<`).



**Important Notes:**

- It is crucial to submit a working program (Non-working applications will not be considered).
- You must work on one file ONLY ("list_todo.h" that includes all your code).


## Task 2 - Stack

For this task, you have been given following files:

- **stack_tests.h**: Contains some required code (you should NOT modify this file)
- **stack_todo.h**: Will contain the code that you must fill.

The aim of the code is to implement a dynamic linked list of int values. The struct of each node and the list is provided in the file `stack_todo.h` as follows:

```
class Node {
public:
    int value;
    Node* next;
};

class Stack {
public:
    Node* head;
    int size;
};
```
You need to implement the code for the following methods in the file "todo.h":

- `Stack()`
  - Non-parameters constructor.

- `Stack(int v)`
  - With-parameters constructor.

- `Stack(Stack& l)`
  - A copy constructor.

- `~Stack()`
  - A destructor.

- `void push(int v)`
  - A method to add a new value to the top of the Stack.

- `int pop()`
  - A method that returns the value that exists in the last node of the Stack and removes this node.
 
- `bool operator==(const List& rhs)`
  - A method to compare between two stack using the == operator.

- `bool operator!=(const List& rhs)`
  - A method to compare between two stack using the != operator.

- `friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, List& l)`
  - A function to create an output stream from a stack using the `operator <<` (this is mainly used to print the list using `cout <<`).

In "main.cpp," you have given different test cases that can help you test your code. Make sure that all of them run successfully when you run your code.



## Task 3 - Generic List
In this exercise, you have three given files (attached to the assignment):

- **tests.h**: Contains some required code (you should NOT modify this file)
- **main.cpp**: Contains different test cases that you need to verify.
- **todo.h**: Will contain the code that you must fill.

The aim of the code is to implement a dynamic generic linked list of objects. The struct of each node and the list is provided in the file **todo.h** as follows:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class Node {
public:
    T value;
    Node* next;
};

template <typename T>
class ArrayList {
public:
    Node<T>* head;
    int size;
};
```

You need to implement the code of the following methods (in the file “todo.h”):

- `ArrayList()`
  - Non-parameters constructor.

- `ArrayList(ArrayList<T> v)`
  - With-parameters constructor.

- `ArrayList(ArrayList<T>& l)`
  - A copy constructor.

- `~ArrayList()`
  - A destructor.

- `void add(T v)`
  - A method to add a new value to the end of the arraylist.

- `T pop()`
  - A method that returns the value that exists in the last node of the arraylist and removes this node.

- `bool operator==(const ArrayList<T>& rhs)`
  - A method to compare between two arraylists using == operator.

- `bool operator!=(const ArrayList<T>& rhs)`
  - A method to compare between two arraylists using != operator.

- `friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, ArrayList<T>& l)`
  - A function to create an output stream from an arraylist using `operator <<` (this is mainly used to print the arraylist using `cout<<`).

# Submission
- no worries your final pushed commit before due date will be considered for grading.
